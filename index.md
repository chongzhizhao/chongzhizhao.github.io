# About Me

## Summary of Research

As computing grows in connectivity and heterogeneity, security ought
to be regarded as a first-order design metric as well as performance
and power. To this end, my research involves side-channel attacks,
cache replacement policies, and prefetching.

## Skills

- Beginner: x86 Assembly, LATEX, Raspberry Pi ecosystem
- Intermediate: Python, Verilog, QEMU Emulator, Xilinx Vivado
- Proficient: C/C++, gem5 Simulator, ARMv8 Assembly, Linux OS
