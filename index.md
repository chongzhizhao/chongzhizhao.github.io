# About Me

## Summary of Research
I am curious about the latest progress in microarchitectural security research and how we can defend our computers from a plethora of side channel attacks. I believe that security should be regarded as a first-order design constraint as well as performance and power. To this end, I have been experimenting side channel exploits and devising defense techniques. Additionally, I also work with cache replacement policies and prefetching techniques.
