[This](https://github.com/chongzhizhao/pi-timolo) is a fork from the
[original repo](https://github.com/pageauc/pi-timolo).

The original project offers remote security monitoring with motion tracking,
auto syncing of files, auto twilight transition, and panoramic images.
I intend to apply this project to watching animals passing by my backyard.
Its functionality can be further extended to make certain decisions.
