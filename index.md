# About Me

## Research

As computing grows in connectivity and heterogeneity, security ought to be regarded as
a first-order design metric. To this end, my research explores cache side-channel attacks,
an intersection of computer architecture, systems security, and operating systems.

## Skills

- Beginner: JavaScript, LaTeX, Synopsys Design Compiler
- Intermediate: Python, Verilog, Xilinx Vivado, ARMv8 Assembly, QEMU Emulator, Raspberry Pi, FPGA
- Proficient: C/C++, gem5 Simulator, x86 Assembly, Unix/Linux CLI

## Publications

Yasin, M., **Zhao, C.**, Rajendran, J. (2019). SFLL-HLS: Stripped-Functionality Logic Locking Meets High-Level Synthesis. ICCAD.

## Motto

And he said to all, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his
cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses
his life for my sake will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world
and loses or forfeits himself? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will
the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the
holy angels. But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death
until they see the kingdom of God."

**Luke 9:23-27**
