## Background


## Problems

There was no systematic, holistic methodology for understanding leakage.

## Insights

All side-channel attacks rely on recognizing leaked execution patterns.

Accordingly, we can measure information leakage by computing the correlation
between ground-truth patterns and attacker observed patterns.

## Approaches

Data collection >> similarity analysis >> phase correlation
